		<hr>
		<p>
			I am a senior programmer in the game development industry who has shipped several award-winning titles across a broad range of platforms. I'm currently working at Magic Leap, helping define mixed reality gaming.
		</p>
		<p>
			I enjoy writing clean pragmatic code. When code needs to be optimised, I have a professional level knowledge of C# and C++, which allows me to refactor for speed and performance. I have developed games using several engines, with a special focus on Unity.
		</p>
		<p>
			I have a very optimistic and passionate approach to my work which positively affects those around me. I love programming and am constantly developing myself both professionally and personally.
